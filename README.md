# Rust XCFramework Template
This template allows you to generate a XCFramework for iOS from a Rust crate.
It can then be incorporated in to a Swift package.

To generate the XCFramework, run `make xcframework`. It will be output in `target/crate.xcframework`.

Make sure to keep the headers in the `includes/` directory up-to-date.
